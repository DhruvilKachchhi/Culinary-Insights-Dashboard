# Culinary-Insights-Dashboard

This project involves creating a vibrant, interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze and showcase key insights about restaurant data. The dashboard is divided into four thematic pages, each focusing on distinct aspects of the dataset.

## Overview
The Overview page serves as a summary, presenting key metrics like the total number of restaurants, the average rating, and total votes in card visuals. It includes a donut chart to show the distribution of restaurant types and a bar chart for the count of restaurants, all of which are filterable by state, rating, cost for two, and type.

## Location
The Location page visualizes the geographical spread of restaurants with an interactive map based on latitude and longitude coordinates. Users can explore this data further with filters for state, city, and cuisine.

## Feedback
The Feedback page highlights customer engagement trends. A stacked bar chart displays the count of restaurants by rating, while a stacked column chart sums up votes by state. A scatter plot shows the relationship between votes, ratings, and price range. This page is further enhanced with a cuisine filter to provide focused insights.

## Cost
The Cost page delves into pricing patterns. It features a pie chart illustrating the proportion of price ranges, a treemap displaying the average cost for two by cuisine (focusing on the top 20), and a bar chart summarizing the count of restaurants by their key highlights. Filters for state, price range, and type offer additional exploration options.

The dashboard employs a colorful theme, with navigation buttons for seamless movement between pages, ensuring a user-friendly and visually appealing experience.
